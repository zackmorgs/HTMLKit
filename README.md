a component for every html element. this way whenever you include the component it also brings it's required CSS.

for use with react and such.

i kept writing similar code and figured id save time just making this.

idk what else ill do with it but these sure are easy to extend. 

if you're interested in how they're made check out make.js - code written very fast so not great but aye it works just fine.
