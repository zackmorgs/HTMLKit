#HTMLKit
light autogenerated functional components for every html element.

```
// ./output/$Element.js
import React from 'react';
import './$Element.css'; // empty .css sheet just has $Element {}
// ^ the reason I made this. Now they only load css for elements they need.  

let $Element = props => (
  <$Element {...props}>
    {props.children}
  </$Element>
);

export default $Element;
```

for use with react and such.

i kept writing similar code and figured id save time just making this.

idk what else ill do with it but these sure are easy to extend. 

if you're interested in how they're made check out make.js - code written very fast so not great but aye it works just fine.
